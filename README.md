I noticed that Redux now have something called [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) üßê
It's an official module that "is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic".
It has been ages since I last checked Redux documentation and I never heard about that.
So I thought I give it a try, even though "vanilla" Redux is completelly fine for me.
